###Statements

I make things that live in both geographical space and personal space.

I splice strange loops and curious passageways into existing networks.

I build ways to imagine new kinds of political agency.

I conduct field experiments.

My projects have strained (convoluted?) relationships with functionality.

I fold vast distances into small objects that often disappear.
