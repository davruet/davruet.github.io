[Benedict and Rueter CV](/static/Benedict_Rueter_CV.pdf)

Born in 1978 and 1985 in the United States. Live and work between the United States and Amsterdam, Netherlands.

[Benedict](http://www.marissaleebenedict.com) and [Rueter](http://davidrueter.com)’s site-adapted videos, sculptures, and drawings intercept objects and processes that extend beyond one’s peripheral vision. Often working with architectural or infrastructural elements hidden in plain sight, the duo lodges materiality, voice, intimacy, and at times their own bodies, into the heart of abstract and technologically-produced spaces, where such things seem legible only as objects. Troubling contemporary vocabularies of  scale, representation, and abstraction with historical specificities, Benedict and Rueter pace into and out of exhibition sites, dragging with them fiber optic cables, misused industrial water bottle preforms, abjected modernist diagrams, and pieces of salvaged flooring. In its circulation, their work accumulates and adjusts as it encounters institutional logics, frictional proximities, hearsay, and fragments of collective imagination.

Benedict and Rueter began their collaborative partnership in Chicago, IL (US) in 2015. Their work has been exhibited in venues such as:
 
The 34th Bienal de São Paulo, BR / the 16th Venice Architecture Biennale, Venice, IT / The Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago, IL / Ditch Projects, Springfield, OR, USA / Jan Van Eyck Open Studios, Maastricht, NL / The Renaissance Society, Chicago, IL, USA / EXPO Chicago, Chicago IL, USA / Contemporary Art Brussels, Brussels, BE.
 
Their work has been funded by:

the National Endowment for the Arts (USA) / the [Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts](http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/6206-deposition) / the [Oregon Arts Commission](https://www.oregonartscommission.org/) / the [Museum of Contemporary Photography](https://www.mocp.org/) / the [Ford Family Foundation](https://www.tfff.org/).

Viewers entering Benedict and Rueter's video installation, Dark Fiber, are greeted with scenes of them digging, burying, pulling, cutting, and otherwise installing a fiber-optic cable in the shadows of other, more visible, large-scale infrastructural works. Locations such as the US/Mexico border wall, Chicago-area petroleum refineries, and an Antwerp shipping canal segue into urban, then interior spaces, gradually reducing in scale and increasing in strangeness, until a tiny specialized machine cuts a single strand of fiber in a macro shot. The actual site of the video installation appears near the end of the loop, inviting viewers to see around the frame to find conduits at the edges of their vision, and to imagine filmic industrial worlds, frightening interior sites, and exhibition space as literally and uncannily connected. The video, which inaugurated the artists' collaborative practice in 2015, is updated for each new showing, and as of this writing has traveled to six exhibitions around the world.

Like Dark Fiber, the artists' subsequent work springs from historical, technical, and material research into industrial processes and infrastructure, including municipal and private water systems; petroleum extraction, refinement and circulation; so-called “smart” urban lighting infrastructure; the physical structures that facilitate the circulation of global capital; and abstract diagrammatic languages belonging to engineering, risk management, land surveying, and architecture. In contrast to approaches centered on exposure or transparency, the artists start with the questions: how might one contend with such tenacious and entrenched languages of power, while at the same time refusing to reproduce their claims to aesthetic and representational supremacy? How else might one live in the landscapes these languages build?
