### about
David Rueter is contemporary visual artist. His creative practice makes use of a range of new technologies – including custom software, custom electronics, data dumps and feeds, GIS software, and computer-assisted manufacturing – and a variety of traditional media, including sculpture, photography, film, and performance. His work traces of histories of art and media through embodied and sited means, treating history not as a succession of technical ruptures but as ongoing processes of sedimentation, excavation, entropy, and erasure. 

David's work, including collaborative work with artist Marissa Lee Benedict, has been supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, the Oregon Arts Commission, and the Museum of Contemporary Photography, and has been exhibited internationally at biennials, galleries, and festivals including the 34th São Paulo Bienal, the 16th Venice Architecture Biennale, Contemporary Art Brussels, the International Symposium on Electronic Art, EXPO Chicago, and Northern Spark. Born in Ann Arbor, MI, he holds degrees from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (MFA, Art and Technology Studies) an Oberlin College (BA, Politics).
