At the opening reception of the collaborative show whatever-is-not-here-present-to-our-senses-now, Phil Peters and David Rueter invited a number of artists in attendance to perform site-based readings of their own texts at the showâ€™s closing reception. Each reader was asked to select a location within a 10-minute walking radius of the ACRE gallery.

Between readings, attendees and readers walked from site to site. All were offered oversized Swedish army surplus coats for warmth, and were served hot drinks afterwards.

Readers were Marissa Lee Benedict, Angharad Davies, Pat Elfritz, Sarah Knudtson, Alyssa Moxley, Phil Peters, and David Rueter.
