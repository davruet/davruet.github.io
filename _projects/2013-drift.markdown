I constructed a custom, solar-powered radio beacon buoy that broadcasted a one-second repeating interval of silence. After releasing the buoy into lake Michigan one windy day, I attempted to trace its path for weeks, travelling hundreds of miles along the shore through four states in search of the signal. Aided by detailed wind and current data provided by NOAA, and a custom drift simulation program that I wrote, I found the signal late one night on a beach in Michigan. But the signal was lost the next day, and amidst mounting uncertainty, I gave up the search.
