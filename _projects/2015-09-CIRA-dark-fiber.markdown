To screen [Dark Fiber](http://davidrueter.com/projects/2015-03-dark-fiber.html)
 at EXPO Chicago 2015, Benedict/Rueter constructed the Contestational Infrastructure Research Annex (CIRA), a mobile theater disguised as a telecommunications equipment shelter.

In addition to Dark Fiber, the theater screened a film series entitled *INTERLOCKING SINGLE-MODE 21-STRAND FIBER OPTIC CABLE*, a collection of short films made by past and present CAC members and curated by Benedict and Rueter. 


*Dark Fiber* is a video installation by artists [Benedict](http://marissaleebenedict.com) and Rueter. The 10-minute video features the artists, drilling, burying, and threading fiber optic cable through various landscapes of the western and midwestern USA, and through industrial, commercial, and home interiors. Through practices real and imagined, Benedict and Rueter labor to fabricate a global high-speed telecommunications network.
