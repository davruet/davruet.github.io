Viewers who pick up the telephone receivers can use them to speak with each other, initiating social interactions that are at once intimate and distancing.

This work was produced through a collaboration with artist [Phil Peters](http://philipbpeters.com). Around the turn of the century, as the Bell telephone system connected cities across the US, rural areas were mostly left out. Intrepid ranchers discovered that ad-hoc, decentralized telephone networks could be built out of simple materials at hand, using the pre-existing network of barbed wire fences as transmission lines.
