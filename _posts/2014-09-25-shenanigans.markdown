Today, I’m happy to announce the launch of Shenanigans, a community-powered network of portable WiFi devices that scrambles WiFi-based surveillance systems by impersonating the smartphones and laptops of volunteers. These tracking systems have been gaining popularity recently, and pose a significant threat to real-world location privacy. It’s troubling to think that any large-scale WiFi infrastructure (think Comcast’s xfinitywifi network, for example) might possibly serve as a dense surveillance network, and that such systems are already installed at many locations worldwide.

With enough support, Shenanigans can disrupt these unethical stalkers. Join in today!!!
